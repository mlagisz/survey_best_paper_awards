## Acknowledgement of contributions   
All project participants who contributed any amount of work will be acknowledged as project contributors on the project page, report, presentations, and manuscript. We will mainly use a CRediT-like statement, but we will also keep a more detailed record of individual contributions to specific tasks within the stages of the project. This record will be also made publicly availabe as part of the open project materials.    

## Co-authorship  
Project participants with substantial contributions (as defined below) will become co-authors of the manuscript. They will contribute to data extraction, checking, analyses and report drafting. Substantial contributions could be by doing any 3 of below tasks (each task can be done for more than one Subject Area and each will be independently counted as one task):  
- compliting screening for one Subject Area (100 journals or until 10 eligible awards are fond, whichever earlier)
- extracting award data for or one Subject Area (up to 10 awards)
- extracting past winners data for or one Subject Area (up to 10 awards)
Authorship is also coditional on reading and approving the final manuscript draft before submission and providing personal information (name, affiliation, email) for the submission.   

Additional contribution oportunities will be available via cross-checking extracted data, data cleaning, analyses, visualisations and writing, as needed.  

In the manuscript, first and last authorships will be reserved to the project leads. Subsequent co-autghorship poitions will be determined by tha total amount of contributions, as in the project records. For equal contributions the order of mid-authorship will be alphabetic. All co-authors must read and approve the final manuscript draft before submission. The manuscript will contain a CRediT statement detailing the roles of individual contributors.  


## Final notes   
Project leads reserve the right to interpret and change the contribution rules at any time, if such need arises. In case of any disputes decisions of project leads will be final.
