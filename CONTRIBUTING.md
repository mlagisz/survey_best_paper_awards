# CONTRIBUTION GUIDE    


**Our mission statement:** *Making "best paper" awards for young researchers more equitable and open.* 🌟  


## 💛  Contributing 
We invite early- and mid-career researchers across disciplines to contribute to the project.     

**General:**
 1. We welcome researchers with all backgrounds and walks of life o contribute to any Stage (see above) of this project.   
 2. You dont need any speciall research skills - just attention to detail, Internet access and some time available.
 3. Fill in the Expression Of Interest (EOI) form at: https://forms.gle/J3WPWMTAyWJy3k1v9
 4. One way to start contributing to this project is during an in-person hackathon event at the AIMOS2022 conference, 28-30 November 2022, Melbourne, Australa.
 5. There will be also two virual hackathons hackathons on 6th and 9th of December to enable broad global participation.
 6. It is desirable to attend the hackathons to get familiar with the project and other particiapants, but attendance is not compulsory.
 7. After the initial hackathons, we will work asynchroniously online until we complete all stages of the project.

## 💝  Acknowledgement of contributions   
All project participants who contributed any amount of work, and provided their details, will be acknowledged as project contributors on the project page, report, presentations, and manuscript. We will mainly use a CRediT-like statement, but we will also keep a more detailed record of individual contributions to specific tasks within the stages of the project. This record will be also made publicly availabe as part of the open project materials.    

## 📄 Co-authorship  
Project participants with substantial and high-quality contributions (as defined below) will become co-authors of the manuscript. They will contribute to any or all of these: data extraction, checking, analyses and/or report drafting.   

Substantial contributions could be achieved by performing any 3 of below tasks (each task can be done for more than one Subject Area and each will be independently counted as one task, e.g. you can screen three times and this will be counted as three tasks in total):  
- completing screening for one Subject Area (100 journals or until 10 eligible awards are found, whichever earlier)   
- extracting award data for one Subject Area (up to 10 awards)   
- extracting past winners data for one Subject Area (up to 10 awards)  
- cross checking any of the above tasks   

Authorship is also coditional on reading and approving the final manuscript draft before submission and providing all personal information (e.g., name, affiliation, email) needed for the submission.     

Additional contribution oportunities will be available via data cleaning, analyses, visualisations and writing, as needed and at the discretion of the project leads.   

In the manuscript, first and last authorship positions will be reserved to the project leads (they could be co-first and co-last positions). Subsequent authorship positions will be determined by the total amount and quality of contributions, as in the project records. For equal contributions the order of mid-authorship will be alphabetic. All authors must read and approve the final manuscript draft before submission. The manuscript will contain a CRediT statement detailing the roles of individual authors and contributors.   


## 📍 Final notes   
Project leads reserve the right to interpret and change the contribution rules at any time, if such need arises. In case of any disputes decisions of project leads will be final.
