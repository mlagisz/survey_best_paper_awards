# Cross-disciplinary survey of access and assessment criteria of "best paper" awards  

**Our mission statement:** *Making "best paper" awards for young researchers more equitable and open.* 🌟  

  

(If you are reading this on GitHub, you can also see this repository as a webpage [here](https://mlagisz.github.io/survey_best_paper_awards/)🌍).   

## 🔖 Background   
Research awards can propagate existing biases in academia in terms of rewarding novel results rather than robust and transparent research. They can also contribute to the “Matthew Effect” where already privileged groups become rewarded. As such, revealing which awards do/do not provide equitable access and evaluation can lead to systemic change in how publications, especially these by early career researchers, are assessed and recognised.   

## 🏹 Aims and approach  
This project aims to conduct a survey of current practices in awarding “best papers” awards by research journals and other organisations. Such awards are usually given to early career researchers, potentially influencing their futre academic career trajectory. In this project, we will evaluate accessibility, assessment criteria and historical biases in the lists of past awardees. Evaluation will be performed on a sample of awards from most respected journals and organisations across disciplines. Our findings will be openly available and disseminated in the research community.      

## 🪓 Impact  
We expect that our findings will contribute to culture change fostering more equitable and open science.    

## 💛 Contributing  
We invite early- and mid-career researchers across disciplines to contribute to the project.       

Overall:

## 🗺️ Roadmap   
The project has main 4 Stages:  

### Stage 1: Planning   
- Preparing protocol.  
- Piloting.  
- Registration.  
- Feedback on the protocol (we are currently here!).   
- Hackathon preparation.   

### Stage 2: Screening   
- Screening journal lists from 27 Scimago Subject Areas rankings.   
- Creating award shortlists.   
- Checking shortlists.  

### Stage 3: Data extraction  
- Main data extraction for included awards.   
- Collecting additional data on past winners.    
- Data cross-checking.   
- Preliminary analyses.    

### Stage 4: Analyses and writing   
- Final analyses.   
- Draft report.  
- Contributors feedback.   
- Final report.  
- Sharing data and code in a GitHub repository.  
- Preprint in MetaRxiv.   
- Manuscript.   


## 🚉 Current status    
Stage 1: Planning.    

## 🚀 Protocol   
Initial protocol is now publicly archived on OSF at [https://osf.io/7ez28](https://osf.io/7ez28). But we are now collecting some feedback and making minor adjustements to teh protocol before registering updated version.      

## ⏰ Code of Conduct   
We expect all project contributors to familiarise themselves and follow our [CODE OF CONDUCT](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
