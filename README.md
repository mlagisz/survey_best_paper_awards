# Cross-disciplinary survey of access and assessment criteria of "best paper" awards  

**Our mission statement:** *Making "best paper" awards for young researchers more equitable and open.* 🌟  

  

(If you are reading this on GitHub, you can also see this repository as a webpage [here](https://mlagisz.github.io/survey_best_paper_awards/)🌍).   

## 🔖 Background   
Research awards can propagate existing biases in academia in terms of rewarding novel results rather than robust and transparent research. They can also contribute to the “Matthew Effect” where already privileged groups become rewarded. As such, revealing which awards do/do not provide equitable access and evaluation can lead to systemic change in how publications, especially these by early career researchers, are assessed and recognised.   

## 🏹 Aims and approach  
This project aims to conduct a survey of current practices in awarding “best papers” awards by research journals and other organisations. Such awards are usually given to early career researchers, potentially influencing their futre academic career trajectory. In this project, we will evaluate accessibility, assessment criteria and historical biases in the lists of past awardees. Evaluation will be performed on a sample of awards from most respected journals and organisations across disciplines. Our findings will be openly available and disseminated in the research community.      

## 🪓 Impact  
We expect that our findings will contribute to culture change fostering more equitable and open science.    

## 💛 Contributing  
We invite early- and mid-career researchers across disciplines to contribute to the project.       

Overall:   
- We welcome researchers with all backgrounds and walks of life o contribute to any Stage (see above) of this project.  
- You dont need any speciall skills - just attention to detail, Internet access and some time available.   
- Fill in the Expression Of Interest (EOI) form at: [https://forms.gle/J3WPWMTAyWJy3k1v9](https://forms.gle/J3WPWMTAyWJy3k1v9)
- One way to start contributing to this project is during an in-person hackathon event at the [AIMOS2022 conference](https://www.eventcreate.com/e/aimos2022), 28-30 November 2022, Melbourne, Australa. 
- There will be also two virual hackathons hackathons on 6th and 9th of December to enable broad global participation. 
- It is desirable to attend the hackathons to get familiar with the project and other particiapants, but attendance is not compulsory.
- After the initial hackathons, we will work asynchroniously online until we complete all stages of the project.    
- For more details on how to contribute and contributions recognition see our [CONTRIBUTION GUIDE](/CONTRIBUTING.md).
