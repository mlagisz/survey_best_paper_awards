Countless hours of work result in a submitted manuscript that must undergo a rigorous peer-review process that ensures only the top manuscripts are accepted for publication. The final product, an accepted manuscript, eventually becomes a published paper that is viewed by scientists, clinicians, practicing professionals, students and the public around the world. The rewards of a published paper include, but are not limited to, furthering the knowledge of science and practice, support for future research activities and professional advancement.

During the past six months, ACSM leadership and staff, members of the ACSM Publications Committee and the editors-in-chief of ACSM’s five journals have considered additional ways to recognize the outstanding accomplishments of authors who have published in an ACSM journal. After many discussions, we proudly announce the establishment of an annual Paper of the Year award for each of ACSM’s journals. The process to identify the award winner required each editor-in-chief to work with their journal’s associate editors to select a paper based on the criteria of significance and impact of the article.

Paper of the Year award recipients will be announced annually in Sports Medicine Bulletin in conjunction with the ACSM Annual Meeting. Principle authors and co-authors also will be recognized in an issue of the publishing journal following the annual meeting. Authors will have an opportunity to present a five-minute summary during the publications symposium at annual meeting and will receive a recognition plaque. This year presents an opportunity to bring the publications symposium and Paper of the Year recognitions to ACSM members in unique and engaging ways.

Lindeman (1915-1942) was first presented in 1987 to recognize an outstanding paper written by a young aquatic scientist. The initial gift to create a fund for the Lindeman award was made in 1986 by Lindeman's colleague in graduate school, Charles B. Reif of Wilkes College, PA, and a subsequent gift from Reif continues to support the award. Lindeman received his Ph.D. in March, 1941 from the University of Minnesota, and began postdoctoral work with G. Evelyn Hutchinson at Yale that September. His career was cut short by his death in April, 1942; he was only 27. The paper for which he is most remembered was published posthumously in 1942 (The trophic-dynamic aspect of ecology, Ecology 23: 399-418). The paper is the result of his thesis work on Cedar Creek Bog, Minnesota; he already had a draft version completed when he joined Hutchinson's lab. Hutchinson was instrumental in getting the paper accepted for publication (it was initially rejected by reviewers!). This paper has since become the foundation for research on the flow of energy in plant and animal communities.
