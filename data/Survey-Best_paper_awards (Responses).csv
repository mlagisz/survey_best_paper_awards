Cialdini Prize recognizes the author(s) of a publication that uses field methods and demonstrates relevance to outside groups. It is designed to recognize the publication that best explicates social psychological phenomena principally through the use of field research methods and settings and that thereby demonstrates the relevance of the discipline to communities outside of academic social psychology within a given year.

This prize is intended to encourage work that both uses field methods and settings and has external applicability to outside communities. This prize is not intended for solely laboratory studies that have societal applicability, although reports that incorporate a small number of lab studies in the publication package will not be excluded from consideration if the bulk of the work was completed in the field.

The term “field research methods” is meant to be inclusive of field experiments, and is not limited to correlational or nonexperimental approaches. The term “field research settings” is meant to include naturally-occurring domains in which research participants can expect to find themselves under normal life circumstances and in which they are unlikely to suppose that they are research participants.

Eligible papers must have been published in peer-reviewed journals or as book chapters during the calendar year prior to nomination. For example, to be nominated in 2023, the publication must have been printed in calendar year 2022.

 Research: Methodological advancement, demonstrated through exceptional contribution to methodological innovation (e.g., analysis tool, statistical approach, recruitment technique) or improvement.

Criteria for Evaluation

The article must meet the highest standards in social sciences or humanities research and advance applied linguistics knowledge. The award selection criteria include:

    Significance of the problem being addressed. The issues investigated are important to the field of applied linguistics and the study advances knowledge in an area that is highly valued by the research communities of AAAL.
    Use of compelling theory and cumulative research base. The literature review is well crafted, appropriately invoking or even innovating theories, and demonstrating a deep understanding of the relevant accumulated research.
    Strength of research design. The study is well designed and follows the highest standards of inquiry for qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods, employing instruments, techniques, and procedures that are rigorous and appropriate for the research questions posed.
    Appropriateness of interpretations. The interpretations are well-grounded in the evidence and the limitations are discussed.
    Completeness of reporting. The level of detail of the reporting enables replication and/or theory building, as appropriate.
    Clarity and engagement of writing style. The article (including tables, figures, appendices, and supplementary online materials, if applicable) is well written, in a style that is both clear and engaging, such that readers’ level of understanding and interest is high.
    Promise for inspiring future research directions. The study holds great potential to serve as a model for future research; it offers new ways to conduct research or new research questions to explore.
    Attention to context. The authors show a sophisticated awareness of the constraints and affordances that the specific local context of the research brings for the study.
    Potential to have an impact on language-related human and world problems. The study makes a contribution to knowledge about language that holds the potential for improving the conditions of individuals, groups, and/or societies in the world, beyond the research.
    Attention to vulnerable, disadvantaged, or under-researched populations.

His career was cut short by his death in April, 1942; he was only 27. The paper for which he is most remembered was published posthumously in 1942 (The trophic-dynamic aspect of ecology, Ecology 23: 399-418). The paper is the result of his thesis work on Cedar Creek Bog, Minnesota; he already had a draft version completed when he joined Hutchinson's lab. Hutchinson was instrumental in getting the paper accepted for publication (it was initially rejected by reviewers!). This paper has since become the foundation for research on the flow of energy in plant and animal communities.

Winners for each category will be selected by a jury and an award of €1,000 will be presented at the following EURO-k or IFORS conference. EURO will pay the registration fee for one representative of each paper. 
The purpose of the prize is to distinguish the best papers published in EJOR. General criteria for the evaluation of the papers are: 
the scientific quality of the paper;
the originality of the paper;
the relevance to Operational Research.

EURO Award for the Best EJOR Paper (Guidelines)
Policy
Three awards for the best EJOR papers are presented annually provided there are candidates of sufficient merit. The recipients will be among the authors of papers published in EJOR in the eligibility period. The best survey paper, best application paper, and best theory/methodology paper will be selected by a jury.
Award
Each certificate will be presented at the following EURO-k or IFORS conference and the award of €1,000 will be transferred to the winner(s) shortly after that. There is no registration fee for one representative of each of the award winning papers.
Eligibility
The entries for the prize to award in year N will consist of papers published by EJOR in calendar years N-2 and N-3. Elsevier will provide all necessary information on papers published to enable the jury to determine a shortlist. The jury will go through those papers and select the winners. 
Selection jury
The selection jury consists of five members of recognized stature in the OR community. One member will be a current EJOR editor. The jury includes a core of three members who serve normally a period of three prizes, with one member added at each prize edition. The new member is nominated by the EURO Executive Committee (suggestions will be asked to the jury core) and approved by the EURO Council. The chair is normally the member who is in the final year of service. The EURO EC then selects additionally two members serving only for the current prize edition  and keeps the EURO Council informed about the decision. For each of the three best paper categories, members of the jury will be allocated relevant papers and they will submit their recommendations to the full jury.

Care should be taken to make sure that the selection committee is representative of the various areas of OR. In particular, it is important that no two members come from the same major research area in OR. The jury members must be members of one of the EURO member societies.
If any member of the award jury has a past or current relationship with a nominee that might influence the selection process for reasons other than the merits of the case relative to the award, it is the responsibility of each jury member to bring to the attention of the jury chair such a conflict of interest. The jury chair should propose a response that ensures that the final decision of the jury is exempt from any apparent conflict.

Selection process
Six months prior to the EURO-k/IFORS Conference, the jury will be sent all the relevant publication information by Elsevier. General criteria for the evaluation of the papers are:

the scientific quality of the paper;
the originality of the paper;
the relevance to Operational Research.
In addition, papers will be evaluated according to the specific category of award they are being considered for (survey, application, theory/methodology).

Four months prior to the EURO-k/IFORS Conference the jury will select the winning paper for each of the three categories. Only one award will be made per category. The winning authors will be notified and a representative for each paper will be invited to attend the next EURO-k/IFORS Conference where the award will be presented.

Time Line for the EURO Award for the Best EJOR Paper
t - 1 year        Nomination of the new EABEP jury core member by the Executive Committee. Approval of the new EABEP jury core member by the EURO Council.

Beginning in 1979, up to three awards of $750 each will be presented at each (triennial) International Symposium on Mathematical Programming; they will be paid out of a memorial fund administered by the American Mathematical Society that was established by friends of the late Delbert Ray Fulkerson to encourage mathematical excellence in the fields of research exemplified by his work. Beginning in 1994, the amount of each award is $1,500.
Guidelines
To be eligible, a paper should be the final publication of the main result(s) and should have been published in a recognized journal, or in a comparable, well-refereed volume intended to publish final publications only, during the six calendar years preceding the year of the International Symposium on Mathematical Programming. The publication year for the paper will be defined to be the print publication year, for any volume that appears in print, or the electronic publication year, for any volume that appears only in electronic form. Extended abstracts and prepublications, and articles published in journals, journal sections or proceedings that are intended to publish nonfinal papers, are not included. The extended period of six years is in recognition of the fact that the value of fundamental work cannot always be immediately assessed. The prizes will be given for single papers, not series of papers or books, and in the event of joint authorship the prize will be divided.
The term ""discrete mathematics"" is intended to include graph theory, networks, mathematical optimization, applied combinatorics, and related subjects. While research work in these areas is usually not far removed from practical applications, the judging of papers will be based on their mathematical quality and significance.
The Prize Committee
The Prize Committee for the awards will have two members appointed by the Chair of the MOS and one member appointed by the President of the American Mathematical Society. The committee members will serve for at most two rounds of awards, with terms overlapping where possible for the sake of continuity. One of the initial Mathematical Optimization Society appointees will be the first chair of the committee; subsequent chairs will be chosen by the Prize Committee from among its members and should whenever possible be veterans of the previous round of awards.

I. GENERAL
1. In accordance with a wish expressed by the late Professor William Edward Hodgson Berwick, Sc.D. (Member of the Society 1914-1944, Council 1925-1929, Vice-President 1929) and out of funds provided by Mrs. Berwick, the London Mathematical Society has instituted the award of a Senior Berwick Prize to the author(s) of a definite piece of research of the highest quality that is actually published by the Society..
2. The award of the Senior Berwick Prize shall be considered biennially by the Council of the Society, in even numbered years.
3. No person shall be awarded the Senior Berwick Prize more than once, either as an individual or joint award, although an individual or joint Senior Berwick Prize may be awarded to a person who has previously received a Berwick Prize (either as an individual or joint award).
4. The Prize in year x shall be awarded in respect of a definite piece of mathematical research actually published by the Society in any of the following eligible journals:
• Bulletin of the London Mathematical Society,
• Journal of the London Mathematical Society,
• Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society,
• Transactions of the London Mathematical Society
• Journal of Topology,
• Nonlinearity,
• Journal of Computation & Mathematics,
• Lecture Notes,
• LMS Monographs.
Please note that this list is restricted to those journals over which the London Mathematical Society has editorial control. However, the list will be subject to an annual review.
5. To qualify for the Prize in year x, the definite piece of mathematical research must have been published in any of the eligible journals in the period from 1st January, year x – 8, until 31st December, year x –1.
6. In cases where the Prize is to be awarded to more than one author, all certificates shall bear the names of all authors and the monetary award shall be split equally amongst all winners.
7. Any amendment to these Regulations for the award of the Prize must be made at a regular meeting of Council at which the proposed amendment must receive the support of an absolute majority of those present at the meeting, whether voting or not, in order to take effect.
II. PROCEDURE FOR THE AWARD OF THE SENIOR BERWICK PRIZE IN YEAR X
1. In October, year x – 1, the Council of the Society shall appoint a Prize Committee consisting of from three to nine members of the Society, at least one of whom is not a member of its Council, and shall invite one of them to act as convenor; normally the Committee shall have at least one member on each other Prize Committee appointed, and any number of the Prize Committees may have identical memberships.
2. The December year x – 1, Newsletter shall contain:
(a) an outline of the regulations and arrangements for the award of the Prize;
(b) an invitation to members of the Society to submit their views confidentially in writing
to the President by a date in year x not later than 31st January.
3. The Committee may seek opinions from other mathematicians on candidates and their work in the publications of the Society in the appropriate period.
4. The President and the members of the Prize Committee shall be ineligible for the award of the Prize in years of awards for which they serve.
5. The Committee shall normally present its unanimous written report to the May meeting of the Council of the Society. This report shall consist of either:
(a) a recommendation that the Prize be not awarded that year or:
(b) a recommendation of an author or authors for consideration as prizewinner(s), accompanied by a detailed citation.
If the Committee fails to reach a unanimous decision, the Prize shall not be awarded that year.
6. At the meeting of Council, there shall be a discussion of the report followed by a ballot which must be secret if any member of Council requests it. No award shall be made unless supported by an absolute majority of the members of Council present at the meeting, whether voting or not. The failure of Council to approve the recommendation of 5(b) shall be regarded as equivalent to a decision that the Prize be not awarded that year. At its discretion, the Council may, instead of a ballot, refer the matter back to the Committee for further consideration, and request a further written report to be presented to the June Council meeting, when a ballot shall be held as previously described.
In the event that the Prize has not been awarded by the October meeting of Council in any year, the Prize shall not be awarded that year.
7. The decision of the Council shall normally be announced to the June meeting of the Society, and in the next Newsletter after that.
III. AWARD
1. The winner(s) of the Senior Berwick Prize shall be given a Diploma signed by the President and the General Secretary of the Society together with such a sum of money as shall have been determined by the Council of the Society.

The committee is chaired by Shelley MacDermid Wadsworth, distinguished professor at Purdue University. Using a variety of criteria, the committee chair invites reviewers to serve. For example, reviewers are selected to represent a variety of scientific fields and institutions. International representation is desirable. Each year, nominees and winners from the prior year are invited to serve on the committee. Volunteers are invited to join the committee via work-family networks and listservs. Both junior and advanced scholars are invited to serve, but most members are senior scholars with long publication records. Membership on the committee rotates on a staggered cycle of approximately three years. 
  https://centers.purdue.edu/cff/initiatives/kanteraward/committee/",no,,no,,yes,"Award Criteria

The basic criterion for selection of the Kanter nominees and winners is quality. For researchers, this means scientific rigor. What indicators of rigor do the nominated studies exemplify?

Strong connections to theory
By linking their ideas to theoretical schools of thought, the authors position their studies at the leading edge of existing knowledge. Their findings not only test their own hypotheses, but the propositions of entire theories. As the evidence for or against particular theories mounts, researchers can focus their energies on ideas with the greatest likelihood of being correct.

Large samples
In addition to being large, many of the samples are randomly selected and/or nationally representative. When not large, samples typically comprise hard-to-find or theoretically important groups.

Detailed data
Many of the studies use longitudinal data. The data sources are also diverse, such as policy analysis, time-use studies, in-depth interviews, or public records of organizational performance.

Creativity
Throughout the studies there are many examples of researchers developing creative solutions to research problems. A couple examples from past nominees include working around the problem of trying to develop a representative sample with limited resources and a pool of volunteer respondents (who usually aren’t representative) and using transition to retirement to reveal the dynamics of dividing household labor.

The selection of journals is guided using four sources: an empirical study by Bob Drago identifying where most of the work-family literature appears, the journals most frequently appearing in the citation database developed by the Sloan Work-Family Researchers’ Network, and an informal survey of leading researchers about the journals they regularly read. Members of the review panel are also surveyed each year about journals they recommend adding to the list.",I suspect an overlap of journals considered since this award consider around 80 journals for the award,,,,,,

Papers published between July 2020 and June 2022 were considered for the fourth prize, which has been awarded to Oleg Itskhoki and Dmitry Mukhin for ""Exchange Rate Disconnect in General Equilibrium"" (Journal of Political Economy 129 [8]: 2183-2232).

Itskhoki and Mukhin develop a general equilibrium model of exchange rate determination, which offers a unifying resolution to a range of outstanding emprical puzzles in international macroeconomics. The puzzles the paper addresses all pertain to ""exchange rate disconnect"": the observation that despite substantial business cycle co-movement in real variables across countries, and although exchange rates are the main prices in international markets, there is very little correlation between exchange rates and other macro variables. Exchange rate disconnect is at the heart of the puzzles this paper tackles: (i) the Meese-Rogoff (1993) puzzle, (ii) the PPP puzzle (Rogoff (1996)), (iii) the LOP/Terms-of-Trade puzzle (Engel 1999, Atkeson-Burstein 2008), (iv) the Backus-Smith (1993) puzzle, and (v) the forward-premium puzzle (Fama 1984).

The exogenous shocks in Itskhoki and Mukhin's theory originate in financial markets. They posit an imperfect financial market with noise traders in which international transactions are mediated through risk-averse arbitrageurs. They show that when combined with home bias in the product market, persistent demand shocks in the financial market are the only type of shock that can qualitatively generate the patterns of co-movement implied by the aforementioned puzzles. They go on to show how various additional frictions that lead to incomplete pass-through, including pricing to market and foreign currency price stickiness, can improve the quantitative fit of the model. Overall, this paper succeeds where the existing literature has failed. Through a combination of theoretical and empirical work, Itskhoki and Mukhin have greatly advanced our understanding of exchange rate dynamics.",not available,No such document is available.,not available,No such document is available.,not available,No such document is available.,https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/journals/jpe/lucas-prize,2023,2017,,,,,,,,

In this case, each related publication must comply with all other eligibility requirements. Nominations of multiple related publications should explain the single program of study that justifies considering the nominated publications as a whole.”

He performed numerous cadaveric and clinical studies to develop the concept of anatomical repair of injured structures in the knee and developed a classification system based on his clinical observations and studies.

Dr. Hughston served as President of AOSSM from 1974-75, Editor of AJSM from 1972-1990, and Chairman of AJSM from 1990-2001. Dr. Hughston was instrumental in organizing other physicians throughout the country to form the AOSSM, and in the late 1970s, he developed what became AJSM.
